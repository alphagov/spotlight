Once received some of these transactions are processed automatically whilst others require manual intervention and subsequently incur greater costs. As fewer transactions are lodged through non-digital channels a greater proportion of digital transactions require such manual intervention. Therefore whilst overall efficiency of a service may improve, the calculated average cost per digital transaction may be negatively impacted.<br><br>Land Registry costs are based on total costs per the 2014/15 published accounts (excluding exceptional items). Because our costs do not incur evenly, transaction costs based on published annual accounts represent a more stable reflection of the costs of delivering services and exclude changes purely resulting from the uneven profile of our costs. Apportioned costs include (but are not limited to) labour, accommodation, office equipment, information services, depreciation, provisions, fees paid, and general overheads; all attributed using the most appropriate cost driver. Costs also include that of indemnity, being compensation paid to injured parties such as victims of property fraud. Payments and required movements in the provision for such payments (as determined by an independent actuary) create a significant degree of annual fluctuation in costs which impact on cost per transaction accordingly.","Digital transactions are defined as those lodged and processed electronically, and those lodged electronically but which require some manual intervention.

Once received some of these transactions are processed automatically whilst others require manual intervention and subsequently incur greater costs. As fewer transactions are lodged through non-digital channels a greater proportion of digital transactions require such manual intervention. Therefore whilst overall efficiency of a service may improve, the calculated average cost per digital transaction may be negatively impacted.<br><br>Land Registry costs are based on total costs per the 2014/15 published accounts (excluding exceptional items). Because our costs do not incur evenly, transaction costs based on published annual accounts represent a more stable reflection of the costs of delivering services and exclude changes purely resulting from the uneven profile of our costs. Apportioned costs include (but are not limited to) labour, accommodation, office equipment, information services, depreciation, provisions, fees paid, and general overheads; all attributed using the most appropriate cost driver. Costs also include that of indemnity, being compensation paid to injured parties such as victims of property fraud. Payments and required movements in the provision for such payments (as determined by an independent actuary) create a significant degree of annual fluctuation in costs which impact on cost per transaction accordingly.","Copies of the register, plan and documents referred to in the register can be requested. An official copy is guaranteed by Land Registry to be accurate at the time it was produced. Official copies are admissible in court and are used in house purchases and court proceedings.<br/><br/>Applications lodged electronically may still require some manual intervention.

UK Shared Business Services Ltd (UK SBS) - formerly SSC RCUK Shared Services Centre Ltd (SSC) was formally registered as a company in 2007. It was initially established by the seven UK Research Councils in a drive for greater efficiency and harmonisation of processes. The project to set up the SSC completed in April 2011. During the transitional phase Research Councils grant application functions were transferred from individual Councils to the SSC, who are now the central point for all grant applications the Research Councils receive. Due to this change, the individual Councils no longer own separate functionality for grants processing and therefore should not be reporting as individual companies, but via the SSC as a single RCUK service which spans the whole of the Research Councils. As UK SBS will formally be taking on further grant process activity for other organisations, the description ensures that the distinction is made that these are just the Research Councils’ grants.

Costs are calculated for online and NCC only as it is not possible to attribute a cost to making an appointment on session. If appointments were no longer made on sessions, the costs and number of staff on the session would not change. Costs for mailing appointment confirmations/DHCs are not included in the total costs to ensure that the 'total cost' and 'digital cost' are directly comparable. Although mailing costs can be added to the 'total cost', they cannot be separated out for 'digital costs' as many appointments made online still receive mail. The appointment transactions include cancellations. Approximately 80% of the transactions are appointments (initial or after a cancellation) and 20% are cancellations. ","The website for the service was updated at the end of 2013, resulting in significant reduction in calls to make or cancel appointments.

Variations to 2011 to 2012 volumes have arisen from a new approach to understanding the VAT service: many transaction services begin digitally but require additional manual intervention in order to complete the transaction effectively, eg identify and deal with basic errors, request additional customer data or apply an assessment of risk. HMRC have been trialling a new approach to measurement which captures this additional processing cost in order to identify the true cost of digital.  This will allow the business to track benefit of moving from a digital “front end only” to digitising the “end-to-end process” and provide the necessary information to make decisions around business process re-engineering and digital re-investment. <br>3.
