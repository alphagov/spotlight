Once received some of these transactions are processed automatically whilst others require manual intervention and subsequently incur greater costs. As fewer transactions are lodged through non-digital channels a greater proportion of digital transactions require such manual intervention. Therefore whilst overall efficiency of a service may improve, the calculated average cost per digital transaction may be negatively impacted.<br><br>Land Registry costs are based on total costs per the 2014/15 published accounts (excluding exceptional items). Because our costs do not incur evenly, transaction costs based on published annual accounts represent a more stable reflection of the costs of delivering services and exclude changes purely resulting from the uneven profile of our costs. Apportioned costs include (but are not limited to) labour, accommodation, office equipment, information services, depreciation, provisions, fees paid, and general overheads; all attributed using the most appropriate cost driver. Costs also include that of indemnity, being compensation paid to injured parties such as victims of property fraud. Payments and required movements in the provision for such payments (as determined by an independent actuary) create a significant degree of annual fluctuation in costs which impact on cost per transaction accordingly.","Digital transactions are defined as those lodged and processed electronically, and those lodged electronically but which require some manual intervention.

Once received some of these transactions are processed automatically whilst others require manual intervention and subsequently incur greater costs. As fewer transactions are lodged through non-digital channels a greater proportion of digital transactions require such manual intervention. Therefore whilst overall efficiency of a service may improve, the calculated average cost per digital transaction may be negatively impacted.<br><br>Land Registry costs are based on total costs per the 2014/15 published accounts (excluding exceptional items). Because our costs do not incur evenly, transaction costs based on published annual accounts represent a more stable reflection of the costs of delivering services and exclude changes purely resulting from the uneven profile of our costs. Apportioned costs include (but are not limited to) labour, accommodation, office equipment, information services, depreciation, provisions, fees paid, and general overheads; all attributed using the most appropriate cost driver. Costs also include that of indemnity, being compensation paid to injured parties such as victims of property fraud. Payments and required movements in the provision for such payments (as determined by an independent actuary) create a significant degree of annual fluctuation in costs which impact on cost per transaction accordingly.","Copies of the register, plan and documents referred to in the register can be requested. An official copy is guaranteed by Land Registry to be accurate at the time it was produced. Official copies are admissible in court and are used in house purchases and court proceedings.<br/><br/>Applications lodged electronically may still require some manual intervention.

UK Shared Business Services Ltd (UK SBS) - formerly SSC RCUK Shared Services Centre Ltd (SSC) was formally registered as a company in 2007. It was initially established by the seven UK Research Councils in a drive for greater efficiency and harmonisation of processes. The project to set up the SSC completed in April 2011. During the transitional phase Research Councils grant application functions were transferred from individual Councils to the SSC, who are now the central point for all grant applications the Research Councils receive. Due to this change, the individual Councils no longer own separate functionality for grants processing and therefore should not be reporting as individual companies, but via the SSC as a single RCUK service which spans the whole of the Research Councils. As UK SBS will formally be taking on further grant process activity for other organisations, the description ensures that the distinction is made that these are just the Research Councils’ grants.

The number of PAYE transactions increased significantly following the introduction of Real Time Information (RTI) in April 2013. When reporting in real time, employers send PAYE information electronically each time they pay their employees as part of routine payroll processes, rather than sending a separate return at the end of the year. The returns include details of their employees’ pay, tax and deductions. Reporting PAYE information in real time will improve PAYE making it quicker, easier and more accurate.

Variations to 2011 to 2012 volumes have arisen from a new approach to understanding the VAT service: many transaction services begin digitally but require additional manual intervention in order to complete the transaction effectively, eg identify and deal with basic errors, request additional customer data or apply an assessment of risk. HMRC have been trialling a new approach to measurement which captures this additional processing cost in order to identify the true cost of digital.
