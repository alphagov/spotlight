Therefore whilst overall efficiency of a service may improve, the calculated average cost per digital transaction may be negatively impacted.<br><br>Land Registry costs are based on total costs per the 2014/15 published accounts (excluding exceptional items).

Apportioned costs include (but are not limited to) labour, accommodation, office equipment, information services, depreciation, provisions, fees paid, and general overheads; all attributed using the most appropriate cost driver. Costs also include that of indemnity, being compensation paid to injured parties such as victims of property fraud. Payments and required movements in the provision for such payments (as determined by an independent actuary) create a significant degree of annual fluctuation in costs which impact on cost per transaction accordingly.","Copies of the register, plan and documents referred to in the register can be requested.

Once received some of these transactions are processed automatically whilst others require manual intervention and subsequently incur greater costs. As fewer transactions are lodged through non-digital channels a greater proportion of digital transactions require such manual intervention. Therefore whilst overall efficiency of a service may improve, the calculated average cost per digital transaction may be negatively impacted.<br><br>Land Registry costs are based on total costs per the 2014/15 published accounts (excluding exceptional items). Because our costs do not incur evenly, transaction costs based on published annual accounts represent a more stable reflection of the costs of delivering services and exclude changes purely resulting from the uneven profile of our costs. Apportioned costs include (but are not limited to) labour, accommodation, office equipment, information services, depreciation, provisions, fees paid, and general overheads; all attributed using the most appropriate cost driver. Costs also include that of indemnity, being compensation paid to injured parties such as victims of property fraud. Payments and required movements in the provision for such payments (as determined by an independent actuary) create a significant degree of annual fluctuation in costs which impact on cost per transaction accordingly.","A person who wishes to protect a future update to the register, such as a purchase or a mortgage, may make an official search against the registered title.
