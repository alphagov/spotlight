If appointments were no longer made on sessions, the costs and number of staff on the session would not change. Costs for mailing appointment confirmations/DHCs are not included in the total costs to ensure that the 'total cost' and 'digital cost' are directly comparable. Although mailing costs can be added to the 'total cost', they cannot be separated out for 'digital costs' as many appointments made online still receive mail. The appointment transactions include cancellations. Approximately 80% of the transactions are appointments (initial or after a cancellation) and 20% are cancellations.

HMRC is introducing PAYE Online, a new service to help individuals to manage their tax affairs and to deal with more complex areas such as tax codes and employer benefits. <br>2. The number of PAYE transactions increased significantly following the introduction of Real Time Information (RTI) in April 2013. When reporting in real time, employers send PAYE information electronically each time they pay their employees as part of routine payroll processes, rather than sending a separate return at the end of the year. The returns include details of their employees’ pay, tax and deductions. Reporting PAYE information in real time will improve PAYE making it quicker, easier and more accurate. ",Business,Taxpayers
