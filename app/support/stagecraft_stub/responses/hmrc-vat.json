HMRC have been trialling a new approach to measurement which captures this additional processing cost in order to identify the true cost of digital.  This will allow the business to track benefit of moving from a digital “front end only” to digitising the “end-to-end process” and provide the necessary information to make decisions around business process re-engineering and digital re-investment. <br>3.
