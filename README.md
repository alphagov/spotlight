# Spotlight #

Hybrid rendering app for the GOV.UK Performance Platform

## Installation ##

This app runs inside [the Performance Platform development environment][ppdev],
not in the standard GDS development VM.

[ppdev]: https://github.com/alphagov/pp-development

Install dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli@0.1.9
npm install
```

## Building and running app ##

### Development ###

First, you need to create a development build of the assets:

```bash
cd <spotlight_dir>
grunt
```

If you're using the PP dev environment `cd /var/apps/pp-development` and then
`bowl performance`. If you've set up your DNS, `http://spotlight.dev.gov.uk`
will work.

Otherwise...
```bash
node app/server.js
```

This will run the app at
`http://localhost:3057`.

At the moment, you need to restart the app for file changes to take effect.

#### Running tests ####

`grunt jasmine` to execute Jasmine tests in PhantomJS.

When the app is running in development mode, Jasmine tests are available at
`http://localhost:3000/spec`. You need to re-run `grunt jasmine` whenever the
list of spec files changes to recreate the specrunner for use in the browser.

### Production ###

`grunt build:production` to create a production release.

`NODE_ENV=production node app/server.js` to run the app in production mode.
