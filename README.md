# Spotlight #

Hybrid rendering app for the GOV.UK Performance Platform

## Installation ##

This app runs inside [the Performance Platform development environment][ppdev],
not in the standard GDS development VM.

[ppdev]: https://github.com/alphagov/pp-development

Install dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli@0.1.9
npm install
```

## Building and running app ##

### Development ###

If you're using the PP dev environment `cd /var/apps/pp-development` and then
`bowl performance`. If you've set up your DNS, `http://spotlight.dev.gov.uk`
will work.

Otherwise...
```bash
cd <spotlight_dir>
grunt
```

This will create a development build of the assets and then run the app at
`http://localhost:3057`.

The app uses [grunt-nodemon](https://github.com/ChrisWren/grunt-nodemon) and [grunt-contrib-watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) to monitor changes and automatically restart the server and recompile SASS.

#### Running tests ####

`grunt jasmine` to execute Jasmine tests in PhantomJS.

When the app is running in development mode, Jasmine tests are available at
`http://localhost:3000/spec`. You need to re-run `grunt jasmine` whenever the
list of spec files changes to recreate the specrunner for use in the browser.

### Production ###

`grunt build:production` to create a production release.

`NODE_ENV=production node app/server.js` to run the app in production mode.
