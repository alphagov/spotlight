# Contribution guidelines

We welcome patches!

## Commit hygiene

Please see our [git style guide][gitstyle]
which describes how we prefer git history and commit messages to read.

## JavaScript

We have a [JavaScript style guide][jsstyle]. The most important things to note are:

1. Use `.js-` prefixed classnames in HTML for JavaScript-only HTML classes
2. JavaScript filenames should be lowercase and use underscores rather than hyphens
3. URLs should contain hyphens rather than underscores
